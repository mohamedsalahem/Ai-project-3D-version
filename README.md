# 🧠 3D AI Search Algorithms Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **3D simulation** designed to visualize and compare the behavior of several **classical AI search algorithms**.  
It provides an **interactive environment** where users can observe how different algorithms traverse a search space to find the **optimal path** from a start point to a goal.

The project is implemented in **TypeScript** and leverages **3D graphics** to make the learning experience more **intuitive and engaging**.

## 🔍 Algorithms Implemented
The following search algorithms are included in this simulation:

- **A\*** (A-Star)  
  Finds the shortest path using heuristics.

- **DFS** (Depth-First Search)  
  Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)  
  Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.

- **UCS** (Uniform Cost Search)  
  Finds the least-cost path in a weighted graph.

- **IDS** (Iterative Deepening Search)  
  Combines the depth-limited approach with iterative deepening.
